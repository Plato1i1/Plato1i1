# Come for the Games, Stay for the People

## Platoâ€™s Story

In the early days of the Internet, our founders created the original Yahoo! Games and grew it to be the largest online games portal of its day. It was amazingly gratifying to witness so many people around the world playing games and connecting on such a large scale.

In 2014, we re-formed as Plato with the same DNA to continue the same mission - bringing people closer together through great games.

Fast forward to today, we are humbled that millions of players are enjoying our games and creating lasting friendships daily on Plato.
